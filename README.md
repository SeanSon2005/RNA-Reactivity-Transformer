# RNA-Reactivity-Transformer
train and deploy a model capable of predicting reactivities from an RNA sequence

How to train my model:
1. Pray that you have the requirements installed
2. Create a data and runs folder
3. Download train_data.csv and move it to the data folder
4. run filterDataFrame.py
5. run train.py

How to generate submission:
1. Pray that you have the requirements installed
2. Create a submissions folder
3. Go into generateSubmission.py and specify location of weights
4. run generateSubmission.py
